# **Monster Hunter Worlds:**   *Weapons Guide*

--- 
## **Description:**
 The purpose of this app is to assist Monster Hunter Worlds players in planning,creating, saving, and viewing weapon builds. My goal in making this was to build a fully functional CRUD app that is both useful and tied to something I really enjoy.
